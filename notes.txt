Why Angular?
    To build "maintainable" applications

Angular Building Blocks
    Components
        User Interaction Responsibility
            Presentation
            Interaction Logic
            State

    Services
        Non UI logic

    Modules
        Application Registry for entities

    Directives
        DOM manipulation

    Pipes
        Data transformation for presentation

Maintainable == Testable


fn(....) => result

function fn(){
    if(){
        if(){
            if(){

            }
        }
    }

Write a Greeter service that will greet the given greet message
    if the time of the day is from 00:00 Hrs to 12:00 
        Hi <name>, Good Morning!
    else
        Hi <name>, Good Day!


Synchronous Operation
    Wait for the operation to complete

Asynchronous Operation
    Do not wait for the operation to complete

Handling the async operations
    callbacks
    events
    promises
    async await
    observables
        = inverse of enumerable
            enumerable = lazy iterable (generator in javascript)

        stream of data (events)

    Source of events in a web application
        User Interaction (stream)
        Timer (stream)
        AJAX (singular)
        Web Socket (stream)
        Server Sent Events (stream)

Testing async operation

    Macrotask & Microtask
    Macrotask (setTimout, setInterval, setImmediate)
        APIs for flusing macrotasks - flush, tick

    Microtask (promise, observables, process.nextTick)
        APIs for flushing microtasks - flushMicrotask
        
    A macrotask can result in multiple microtasks
    The microtasks queue of one macrotask has to cleared to execute the next macrotask
